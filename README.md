# Studio Ghibli Clone
## Purpose
This is a clone of the Studio Ghibli website built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to learn how to create a responsive website with Tailwind CSS.

## Lessons Learned
I learned to use Tailwind CSS classes to style and animate elements, and breakpoints to achieve responsive design.
